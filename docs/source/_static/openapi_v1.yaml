        \ cancel the execution, use the /v1/runs/{application_run_id} endpoint.\n\n\
        ### Payload\n\nThe payload includes `application_version_id` and `items` base\
        \ fields.\n\n`application_version_id` is the id used for `/v1/versions/{application_id}`\
        \ endpoint.\n\n`items` includes the list of the items to process (slides,\
        \ in case of HETA application).\nEvery item has a set of standard fields defined\
        \ by the API, plus the metadata, specific to the\nchosen application.\n\n\
        Example payload structure with the comments:\n```\n{\n    application_version_id:\
        \ \"heta:v1.0.0\",\n    items: [{\n        \"reference\": \"slide_1\"  <--\

        : \"https://...\" <-- signed URL to the input file in the S3 or GCS. Should\
        \ be valid for more than 6 days\n            \"metadata\": { <-- The metadata\
        \ fields defined by the application. (The example fields set for a slide files\
        \ are provided)\n                \"checksum_crc32c\": \"abc12==\",\n     \
        \           \"mime_type\": \"image/tiff\",\n                \"height\": 100,\n\
        \                \"weight\": 500,\n                \"mpp\": 0.543\n      \
        \      }\n        }]\n    }]\n}\n```\n\n### Response\n\nThe endpoint returns\
        \ the application run UUID. After that the job is scheduled for the\nexecution\
        \ in the background.\n\nTo check the status of the run call `v1/runs/{application_run_id}`.\n\
        \n### Rejection\n\nApart from the authentication, authorization and malformed\
